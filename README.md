## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Express, Mongodb

Why was this stack chosen?

Node is a pretty lightweight server choice and can be spun up fairly easily. We needed a backend that could easily implement CRUD functionality based on the input of the user and the ability to dynamically render the stories. By using Express' built in middleware architecture we could cleanly write fallbacks and we can access the data seasmlessly using Mongodb.

## Lessons Learned:

Learnt the use of Express, Mongodb & Heroku, makes building and deploying CRUD apps very easy
